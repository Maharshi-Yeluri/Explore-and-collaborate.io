							<p>Hello I am Maharshi</p>
							<p>Explore and collaborate it a two sided community, so it works with differently based on what type of user you are. I think of all the users as Students, Entrepreneurs and/or Explorers. Entrepreneurs are people who provide a product or service solution. Explorers are people who want to part of the solution by being an investor, advisor, employees, cofounder etc.

Entrepreneurs can publish their startup or just a business idea on Launchise. Once they publish it, the whole user community of Explore and collaborate will see that as a venture. Each person can view the venture, along with all the details, and provide feedback. The feedback is very simple. They pick from two icons and it triggers options for the user to select why they made that specific choice. The entrepreneur can see the data of who likes/dislikes their product and why. Additionally, each user has a profile with some basic information and preferences so people can connect and chat for collaboration opportunities.

Career Companion is like a companion for your career. A user can log in and manage all aspects of their career. There are few core components of Career Companion, starting with the modules to better understand oneself with five key aspects:
1. Career Questions
2. Career Goals
3. Career Competencies
4. Career Assets
5. Career Assessments

Then, there are modules to help you manage your job search and succeeding in a specific role:
1. Job Funnel
2. Job Details
3. Interview Readiness

Finally, there are modules to help with day-to-day learnings:
1. Reflection Space
2. Tools & Resources

Explore and collaborate is unique because it provides users the ability to gather feedback at a very early stage, including when you are just ideating. Also, it helps be find the right people to build and scale your business.

Career Companion is actually a first comprehensive career platform that lets you manage your career in a systematic way. Traditionally, people have used google docs and email to manage all this information about their career. I wanted to combine those best practices in a product that helps streamline how you think about and manage your career.</p>
